#Using Loop Function
##for() loop
  1. 1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.
  Hint Use abs() function to get the absolute value
```{r}
vectorA <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
matrixA <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

for(i in 1:5){

    matrixA[i, ] <- abs(vectorA - i)
}
matrixA
```
  2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in Figure
```{r}
for(i in 1:5){

    cat(rep("*", i), "\n")
  
}
```
  3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.
```{r}
#There's an error during knitting in this particular chunk. So I just commented the prompt script an initialize 4 as the temporary user input.
#start <- as.integer(readline(prompt = "Enter the starting number: "))
start <- 4

a <- start
b <- start + 1

cat(a, "\n")

repeat {
  cat(b, "\n")
  
  next_term <- a + b
  
  if (next_term > 500) {
    break
  }
  
  a <- b
  b <- next_term
}

```

##Using Basic Graphics (plot(),barplot(),pie(),hist())
  4. Import the dataset as shown in Figure 1 you have created previously.
    - a. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of the dataset? Show your codes and its result
```{r}
ShoeSize_Data <- read.csv("ShoeSize.csv")
head(ShoeSize_Data)
```
    - b. Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in Male? How about in Female? Write the R scripts and its output.
```{r}
male_sub <- subset(ShoeSize_Data, gender == "M", select = gender)
male_count <- nrow(male_sub)
print(paste("There are", male_count, "males"))

female_sub <- subset(ShoeSize_Data, gender == "F", select = gender)
female_count <- nrow(female_sub)
print(paste("There are", female_count, "females"))
```
    - c.Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(), chart type = barplot. Make sure to place title, legends, and colors. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}
gender_counts <- c(male_count, female_count)
gender_labels <- c("Male", "Female")
barplot(
  gender_counts,
  names.arg = gender_labels,
  main = "Number of Males and Females in Household Data",
  xlab = "Gender",
  ylab = "Count",
  col = c("blue", "#FF00FF")
)

```

##5. The monthly income of Dela Cruz family was spent on the following:
  - a. Create a piechart that will include labels in percentage.Add some colors and title of the chart. Write the R scripts and show its output.
  
  
```{r}
expenses <- c(Food = 60, Electricity = 10, Savings = 5, Miscellaneous = 25)

percent_labels <- paste(names(expenses), round(expenses / sum(expenses) * 100, 1), "%")

pie(
  expenses,
  labels = percent_labels,
  main = "Monthly Expenditure of Dela Cruz Family",
  col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen", "yellow", "pink")
)

```

##6. Use the iris dataset.
  - a. Check for the structure of the dataset using the str() function. Describe what you have seen in the output.
```{r}
# Load the iris dataset
data(iris)

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(iris)

```
  - b. Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length, sepal.width,petal.length,and petal.width. What is the R script and its result?
```{r}
irisMean <- colMeans(iris[, 1:4])
irisMean
```
  - c. Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors. Write the R script and its result.
```{r}
species_counts <- table(iris$Species)

pie(
  species_counts,
  labels = paste(names(species_counts), round(species_counts / sum(species_counts) * 100, 1), "%"),
  main = "Species Distribution in Iris Dataset",
  col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen", "lightpink")
)

legend("topright", legend = names(species_counts), fill = c("lightblue", "lightgreen", "lightpink"))

```
  - d. Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Write the R scripts and show the last six (6) rows of each species.
```{r}
setosa <- subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
versicolor <- subset(iris, Species == "versicolor")
virginica <- subset(iris, Species == "virginica")

tail(setosa)
tail(versicolor)
tail(virginica)

```
  - e. Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the different  species(setosa,versicolor,virginica). Add a title = “Iris Dataset”, subtitle = “Sepal width and length, labels for the x and y axis, the pch symbol and colors should be based on the species.
    Hint: Need to convert to factors the species to store categorical variables.
```{r}
plot(
  iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,
  col = as.numeric(iris$Species),
  pch = as.numeric(iris$Species),
  main = "Iris Dataset",
  sub = "Sepal Width and Length",
  xlab = "Sepal Length",
  ylab = "Sepal Width"
)

legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species), col = 1:3, pch = 1:3)

```
  - f. Interpret the result   
    *The Setosa species' sepal width has a relation to its sepal length. The longer the length, the wider it's width.
    *While the Versicolor and Virginica species tend to overlap in the middle. The longer their length, their width almost stays the same arounf 3.0.
    
#Basic Cleaning and Transformation of Objects
##7. Import the alexa-file.xlsx. Check on the variations. Notice that there are extra whitespaces among black variants (Black Dot, Black Plus, Black Show, Black Spot). Also on the white variants (White Dot, White Plus, White Show, White Spot).
  - a. Rename the white and black variants by using gsub() function.
```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
alexa_data <- read_excel("E:/Github/Data Science Worksheets/DataScience_Worksheets_Camarista/Worksheet#4/alexa_file.xlsx")
head(alexa_data)
```
  **Syntax:**
  RObject$columnName <- gsub("Old Name", "New Name", RObject$columnName)
  Write the R scripts and show an example of the output by getting a snippet. To embed an image into Rmd, use the function below: knitr::include_graphics("file path")
```{r}
alexa_data$variation <- trimws(alexa_data$variation)


  alexa_data$variation <- gsub("Black[[:space:]]+", "Black ", alexa_data$variation)
  alexa_data$variation <- gsub("White[[:space:]]+", "White ", alexa_data$variation)

head(alexa_data)

knitr::include_graphics("E:/Github/Data Science Worksheets/DataScience_Worksheets_Camarista/Worksheet#4/Screenshot 2024-11-01 000948.png")
```
  - b. Get the total number of each variations and save it into another object. Save the object as variations.RData. Write the R scripts. What is its result?
Hint: Use the dplyr package. Make sure to install it before loading the package.
  **Syntax for dplyr**
  RObject %>%
count(RObject$columnName)
```{r}
variant_counts <- alexa_data %>%
  count(variation)

save(variant_counts, file = "variations.RData")

print(variant_counts)

```
  **Sample Output**
  - c. From the variations.RData, create a barplot(). Complete the details of the chart which include the title, color, labels of each bar.
```{r}
load("variations.RData")

barplot(
  variant_counts$n,
  names.arg = variant_counts$variation,
  main = "Distribution of Alexa Variants",
  xlab = "Variants",
  ylab = "Count",
  col = rainbow(length(variant_counts$variation)),
  las = 2
)
print(unique(alexa_data$variant))

```
  - d. Create a barplot() for the black and white variations. Plot it in 1 frame, side by side. Complete the details of the chart.
```{r}
black_variants <- variant_counts %>%
  filter(grepl("Black", variation))

white_variants <- variant_counts %>%
  filter(grepl("White", variation))

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

barplot(
  black_variants$n,
  names.arg = black_variants$variation,
  main = "Black Variants",
  xlab = "Total Numbers",
  ylab = "Variants",
  col = c("black", "red", "green", "blue", "cyan"),
  las = 2
)

barplot(
  white_variants$n,
  names.arg = white_variants$variation,
  main = "White Variants",
  xlab = "Total Numbers",
  ylab = "Variants",
  col = c("black", "red", "green", "blue", "cyan"),
  las = 2
)

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

```
